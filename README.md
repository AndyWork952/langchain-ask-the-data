# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Langchain - Ask the Data App

Build an LLM powered Ask the Data App with Langchain (using the Pandas DataFrame Agent) and Streamlit.

## Overview of the App

This app uses the Pandas DataFrame Agent from Langchain to allow you to ask questions about a Pandas DataFrame.

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://langchain-pandas-agent.streamlit.app/)

## Get an OpenAI API key

You can get your own OpenAI API key by following the following instructions:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
2. Click on the `+ Create new secret key` button.
3. Next, enter an identifier name (optional) and click on the `Create secret key` button.

## Try out the app

Once the app is loaded, do the following in sequential order:
1. Upload a CSV file
2. Select an example query or provide your own custom query by selecting the *Other* option
3. Enter you OpenAI API key

That's all and the Pandas DataFrame Agent will start to work on your query.
